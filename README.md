# devHead

## Description
This developer-focused social-media application allows the user to mangage a list of posts. They can create new post entries, read their posts, update their pre-existing posts, and delete their posts, read other people's posts, and view a list of other users.

## Planning Story
Reviewed project prompts and narrowed it down to a social media site, blog, and picture site. After brainstorming target audiences decided to focus on building a platform for software developers where they can post their projects, questions, and frustrations. At this point the project is a social media site with plans to implement more blog-like features and ability to upload pictures at a later date.
